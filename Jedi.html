          Yoda first appears in the 1980 film <i>The Empire Strikes Back.</i> He's known for his legendary wisdom, mastery of the Force
          and skills in lightsaber combat. Grand Master Yoda spent eight centuries training Jedi. He served as a member of the 
          Jedi Council in the last centuries of the Galactic Republic and oversaw the Jedi Order as Grand Master, during and after 
          the devastating Clone Wars. He was one of the few to survive Emperor Palpatine's Jedi purge and went into exile on the 
          swamp planet of Dagobah.</p><br>

            <p>Mace Windu was a male Human Jedi Master 
            who was the most senior of the Jedi during the final years of the Galactic Republic, after Grand Master Yoda.
            It was Master Windu who led two hundred and twelve Jedi into combat at the Battle of Geonosis and slew 
            the infamous bounty hunter Jango Fett, leading his son Boba Fett to hate Mace Windu and even try to kill him. 
            He continued to serve the Republic throughout the Clone Wars, 
            often leading troops into battle, despite his misgivings about the militarization of the Jedi Order. 
            Windu defeated Darth Sidious in a difficult duel, after being informed by Jedi Knight 
            Anakin Skywalker that Sidious and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine were one and the same same person. Windu was ultimately 
            prevented from slaying Palpatine by Skywalker and forced out the window by Sidious.</p>

                <p>Obi-Wan Kenobi, later known as Ben Kenobi, was a Force-sensitive human male Jedi Master 
                who served the Galactic Republic. He was mentor to both Anakin Skywalker and his son, Luke, training them in the ways of the Force. 
                Kenobi became the first Jedi in a millennium to defeat a Sith Lord when he defeated Darth Maul during the Battle of Naboo. 
                Nineteen years after fighting Anakin and leaving him for dead on planet Mustafar, he recieved a message from R2-D2
                 asking for help in the Rebel Alliance's fight against the Empire. After his death, Kenobi continued to give Luke guidance
                  as a Force Spirit.</p>

                    <p>Trained by Count Dooku, Jinn was considered a maverick within the Jedi Order, one who did not always follow the Jedi Code; 
                    according to his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi,
                    Jinn could have been a member of the Jedi Council if he had followed the Code.
