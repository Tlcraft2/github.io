          <p>The Jedi /ˈdʒɛˌdaɪ/ are a fictional ancient monastic, spiritual, and academic meritocratic organization and the main protagonists in the fictional Star Wars universe, whose origins dates back to circa 25,000 BBY (Before Battle of Yavin; the destruction of the first Death Star). The Jedi Order[1] mostly consists of polymaths: teachers, philosophers, scientists, physicians, diplomats and warriors, who value knowledge and wisdom above nationality. By serving others, the Jedi give of themselves through acts of charity, citizenship, volunteerism, and good deeds. Their traditional weapon is the lightsaber, a device which generates a blade-like controlled plasma flow. The fictional organization has inspired a nontheistic new religious movement[2] in the real world, Jediism.</p>
